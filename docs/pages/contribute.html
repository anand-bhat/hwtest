	Ways to contribute to the <a href="https://foldingathome.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Folding@home</a> project.
</div>
<hr>
<div>
	<h3>Volunteer computing:</h3>
	The easiest way to contribute is by running the free Folding@home software on your computer. Folding@home can be run easily on most computers. If you run into any trouble, the friendly folks (mainly other volunteers) at the <a href="https://foldingforum.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/foldingathome" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord channel</a> can help. In addition to the thousands of users who run Folding@home at home, these <a href="./participatingOrganisations">organisations</a> have also contributed their computational resources to Folding@home. Please ensure you own the computers you use to run Folding@home or have written permission to do so if you're planning on setting this up at your workplace.
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://foldingathome.org/alternative-downloads/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client downloads</a> - The official clients for Windows, Linux (Debian / Mint / Ubuntu, Redhat / Centos / Fedora and ARM Linux / Raspberry Pi) and macOS.</li>
		<li>There are no clients available for Android and iOS devices or gaming consoles at this time.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Assisting other users:</h3>
	If you have been running Folding@home or are familiar with how it works, you could assist other users in the Folding@home community with issues or questions related to Folding@home. While the scientists who work at Folding@home do frequent these forums, a majority of the support is provided by volunteers.

		<li>Folding@home client: The Folding@home client is not open source at this time. There are <a href="https://foldingathome.org/2020/04/17/new-foldinghome-software-with-the-option-to-prioritize-covid-19-projects/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plans</a> to make this open source at some time in the near future. However, certain components of the Folding@home client are already open source:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-control" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-control</a> - The advanced control component to control the client.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-web-client" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-web-client</a> - The web based client.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-client-win-installer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-client-win-installer</a> - The Windows installer.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-client-osx-installer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-client-osx-installer</a> - The macOS installer.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingCommunity/fah-viewer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-viewer</a> - The protein viewer.</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/FoldingAtHome/fah-screensaver" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fah-screensaver</a> - The Windows screensaver.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li>Folding@home science cores: Folding@home uses open source molecular dynamics packages for its simulations.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.gromacs.org/Support/GMX-Developers_List" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GROMACS</a> - Folding@home projects that run on the CPU use the GROMACS package.</li>
				<li><a href="http://openmm.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenMM</a> - Folding@home projects that run on the GPU (Nvidia, AMD and Intel) use the OpenMM package that internally uses OpenCL and CUDA to run code on the GPUs.</li>
